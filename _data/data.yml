    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Experienced Software Engineer in the development of advanced robotic systems mainly for subsea environments. Interested in Robotics, Autonomy, Acoustics, Perception, Simulation, Machine Learning, and Team Leadership. Skilled in C/C++, Python, Ruby, ROS/ROCK, OpenCV, Gazebo, Docker, Boost, Qt, and Git development in Linux. Strong research professional with a doctorate focused on Robotics, and several scientific papers and patents published.

      Over 4 years, I was part of the FlatFish project, an autonomous underwater vehicle for repeated inspections of deep-sea O&G installations. Next, I led the JIRo project, a robotic system specialized in cleaning and inspecting offshore flexible joints. Both projects were developed with Shell Brazil and DFKI GmbH.
